    "It performs poorly if data has a lot of noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "Advantages of random forests are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is one of the most accurate learning algorithms available. For many data sets, it produces a highly accurate classifier.\n",
    "2. It runs efficiently on large databases.\n",
    "3. It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.\n",
    "4. It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification.\n",
    "5. It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error as the forest building progresses.\n",
    "6. It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing\n",
    "7. It has methods for balancing error in class population unbalanced data sets. \n",
    "8. Generated forests can be saved for future use on other data. \n",
    "9. Prototypes are computed that give information about the relation between the variables and the classification. \n",
    "10. It computes proximities between pairs of cases that can be used in clustering, locating outliers, or (by scaling) give interesting views of the data. \n",
